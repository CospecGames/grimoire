# First Program

Starting with the traditionnal "Hello World" :
```cpp
main {
  print("Hello World!");
}
```
The code is composed of the keyword **main**, it's a special function that indicate the entry point of the script.
Then we have a left curly brace `{` with a right curly brace `}` some lines after.
Those curly braces delimit the scope of the statement (here, the **main**).
Everything inside those curly braces (called a **block**) will be executed when the **main** is run.
The whole `print("Hello World!");` form a single expression terminated by a semicolon.

Then we pass the "Hello World!" string to the **print** primitive and here is what the output displays: `Hello World!`.
